# rubocop-daemon-wrapper

A conversion of [fohte/rubocop-daemon/rubocop-daemon-wrapper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fohte/rubocop-daemon/master/bin/rubocop-daemon-wrapper) to rust. The original README mentioned that is something the author had considered, and I wanted a simple project for rust.

My current plan is to use this my self and check that it works well.
